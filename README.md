# LangBot
### Twitter bot created with Cheap Bots, Done Quick!

#### What?
This is the Tracery JSON file used for [The Lang Center for Bot](https://twitter.com/rsidenebkussmau). It runs using [Cheap Bots, Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/), which generates a random tweet and posts once a day.

#### Why?
This was created for an assignment for Theory of Computation at Swarthmore College, by Ray Sidener (me) and Ben Kussmaul (my lab partner). We used [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) for some of our formatted lists of words.

Swarthmore's campus has several different buildings and programs named for alum Eugene Lang (I was once 15 minutes late to class because I went to the wrong Lang Center). This bot creates suggestions for new buildings that could be created and named after Lang.
